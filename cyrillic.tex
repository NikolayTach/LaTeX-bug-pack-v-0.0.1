(latexbug)                If you think the bug is in core LaTeX
(latexbug)                (as maintained by the LaTeX Team) but
(latexbug)                these files are needed to demonstrate
(latexbug)                the problem, please continue and mention
(latexbug)                this explicitly in your bug report
(latexbug)                (with an explanation why you think so).
